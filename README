MosaicMaker v0.9 - README

Compiling:

Just type 'ghc --make -O2 Mosaic.hs'

This is how it works:

Simple usage:
1) Copy the program into a folder that contains the images you want to use 
   in your mosaic (>500 different images are recommended to get good results)

2) run it with the following argument: 'Mosaic analyse'
   This will create the image database in a subfolder called 'mosaicTiles'

3) run it again, this time in generator mode: 'Mosaic generate -f image.jpg'
   where image.jpg' specifies the image you want to turn into a mosaic

4) The resulting mosaic can be found in the file 'mosaic.jpg', in the same folder as the program


More options:

To get a full overview of available options type 'mosaic -h'. A few interesting options are:

- 'Mosaic analyse -s path/to/images'         if your images are in a different folder than the program folder
- 'Mosaic analyse --dbPath path/to/db'	     if you want to create the database somewhere else than the mosaicTiles subFolder

- 'Mosaic generate -f img.jpg -c 128 -r 128  where -c changes the number of columns and -r the number of rows of tiles
